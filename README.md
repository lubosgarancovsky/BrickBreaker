# Brick Breaker
Welcome to Brick Breaker! This project was developed as a personal project while learning Python. It's a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks.

It utilizes <a href="https://www.pygame.org/news">Pygame</a> library and many of its features including sprites and sounds.
